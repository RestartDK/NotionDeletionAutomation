# Notion TODO List Done Deletion Automation MacOS

A python script automated with launchd that will automatically delete items that are "done" in your todo list in Notion weekly.


## Introduction

You have a TODO List. You have checked a task to be done. You are so productive so your finished tasks pile up at the end of the week. It takes up your time to go and manually delete all the tasks on your list. To gain time, I made python automate it for you weekly.
